# Number Classifier

## Description
The Number Classifier is a simple C++ program that prompts the user to input a number and then determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. It's designed to help beginners understand basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, input/output operations, and basic arithmetic operations in C++.

## Features
- **User Input:** Accepts integer inputs from the user.
- **Classification:** Determines if the entered number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Easy to Use:** Clear prompts and immediate feedback on input.

## How to Install and Run
To run the Number Classifier, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. GCC, Clang, and MSVC are some of the popular compilers.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-classifier.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd number-classifier
   ```

### Compilation
Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you can compile the program as follows:
```bash
g++ check_number.cpp -o check_number
```

### Running the Program
After compiling, run the program using:
```bash
./check_number
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a number.

## How It Works
The program starts by asking the user to input a number. After receiving the input, it checks whether the number is greater than, less than, or equal to zero. Based on this check, it outputs whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Why This Project Exists

The Number Classifier program was developed as part of a school assignment with a clear objective: "Write a C++ program that prompts the user to input a number. The program should then output the number and a message saying whether the number is positive, negative, or zero."

This assignment was designed to help students understand and implement basic concepts in C++ programming, including:
- **User Input/Output:** How to interact with users via the console.
- **Conditional Statements:** Using `if-else` statements to make decisions within the program.
- **Basic Program Structure:** Understanding the flow of a simple C++ program.
